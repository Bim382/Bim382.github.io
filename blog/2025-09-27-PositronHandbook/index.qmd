## YAML header

You can make changes to the default YAML header to fit your needs. Refer to the comments on the code in the template for more information.

Work in progress.

## An Example Regression Analysis

Here is an example regression analysis using the ORCID template and the mtcars dataset to show you some basic syntax when you are writing a quantitative academic research paper.

First, let's examine the relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency using a scatter plot.

Insert an r code cell by clicking the "Insert Code Cell" button on the top bar, and copy and paste the following code into the code cell:

```r
# Assign a label to the scatter plot for cross-referencing
# Labels for figures should have the prefix "fig-"
#| label: fig-scatter
# Assign a caption to the scatter plot
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Car Weight and Fuel Efficiency"
# Set echo, warning, and message to false for the plot output only
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# Install the necessary packages
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
# If the packages are already installed, you can skip the above line
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# Create descriptive statistics plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per Gallon",
    color = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Car Weight and Fuel Efficiency"
#| fig-pos: "H"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Create descriptive statistics plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per Gallon",
    color = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Next, we'll perform a regression analysis. Equations written in \LaTeX{} syntax should be covered by double dollar signs `$$ ... $$` and be assigned a label using `{#label}` for cross-referencing.

```r
$$
mpg = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot weight + \beta_2 \cdot cylinders + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-regression}  #Labels for equations should have the prefix "eq-"
```
$$
mpg = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot weight + \beta_2 \cdot cylinders + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-regression}

We can also use "&" to align equations. For example, if we want our equations to be aligned at the equal signs and quote them as one group, we can write:

```r
$$
\begin{aligned}
1+2&=3\\
3+4&=7\\
11&=5+6
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-group}
```
Note that here we use `\begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned}` to align a group of equations, and we use `\\` to indicate line breaks, and `&` to indicate the alignment point.

The three equations are now quoted as one group and aligned at the equal signs:

$$
\begin{aligned}
1+2&=3\\
3+4&=7\\
11&=5+6
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-group}


Finally, let's create a regression table to summarize our regression results. We will use the `modelsummary` package to create a well-formatted regression table.

```r
# Assign a label to the regression table for cross-referencing
# Labels for tables should have the prefix "tbl-"
#| label: tbl-regression
# Assign a caption to the regression table
#| tbl-cap: "Regression Results: Fuel Efficiency Model"
# Set echo, warning, and message to false for the plot output only
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(modelsummary)
# Fit regression models
model1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
model2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
model3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)
# Create regression table
modelsummary(
  list("Model 1" = model1, "Model 2" = model2, "Model 3" = model3),
  stars = TRUE,
  gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "adj.r.squared")
)
```
```{r}
#| label: tbl-regression
#| tbl-cap: "Regression Results: Fuel Efficiency Model"
#| tbl-pos: "H"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(modelsummary)

# Fit regression models
model1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
model2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
model3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)

# Create regression table
modelsummary(
  list("Model 1" = model1, "Model 2" = model2, "Model 3" = model3),
  stars = TRUE,
  gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "adj.r.squared")
)
```

The equations, figures, and tables are automatically numbered in a correct sequence, and could be cross-referenced in the text.

To create proper cross-references in Quarto, use the following syntax: `@label` at where you want to make cross references, where *label* is the label you assigned to the figure, table, or equation. For instance, `@eq-regression` refers to the regression equation @eq-regression, `@eq-group` refers to the group of equations @eq-group, `@fig-scatter` refers to the scatter plot @fig-scatter, and `@tbl-regression` refers to the regression table @tbl-regression. You could refer to [Quarto Cross-References Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#overview) for more information on cross-reference.
