By dragging and dropping the shapes, you can enter the input and output colours.\nFor the easiest problems (as the one below), once you have moved both rows of shapes, the answer is automatically displayed below the line edit:\n\n\n\nEasy problem\n\n\nPS: to clear the formula and answer, hit the ~/` button\nFor the harder question, you may need to enter the formula (from level 4 onward?) and hit Enter. In the formula, you need to replace the options with x：\n\n\n\nMedium problem\n\n\nThe solver can handle x in any position:\n\n\n\nHard problem\n\n\nFor the hardest questions with two choices, you need to make a guess about the first choice, and let the solver find the second choice. If the answer is not correct, you need to try again. You may need to try 3 times at most:\n\n\n\nHardest problem\n\n\nIn this case, the third option of the first choice is the correct answer. This implies that you need to try 3 times if you do from left to right.\n\n\nUsing the full formula\nThere are two ways of using the full formula, long form and short form. In both cases, ignore the shapes in the solver, they don’t do anything. You can even check the box at the top to hide the shapes.\nIn the long form, you enter the input and output colors.\nLet’s use the hard case as an example, the formula would be:\nybgr+1324+x+3241=gbyr\n\n\n\nLong Formula with GUI\n\n\nThe gist of the short formula form is that you encode the outcome (number after =) in such a way that it is a single switch from the input to the output. Note that you cannot use the short formula for the easiest problems (you solve it with your brain).\nLet’s use the hard case as an example:\n\n\n\nShort Formula with GUI\n\n\nYou can hide the shapes by checking the box at the top:\n\n\n\nHide shapes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{yang2024,\n  author = {Yang, Dianyi},\n  title = {Switch {Challenge} {Solver}},\n  date = {2024-09-23},\n  url = {https://bim382.github.io/tools/2024-09-23-SwitchChallenge/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYang, D.

An OLS regression with fixed effects and a 2SLS regression are adopted in this essay. The results confirms the common belief that democracy has a positive curvilinear relationship with terrorism. Countries respecting physical integrity would experience less terrorism. High levels of mobilization would inspire terrorism, and new systematic changes in the dynamic between democracy and terrorism remain to be further explored.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{fu2024,\n  author = {Fu, Yuxin},\n  title = {Revisiting the {Link} Between {Democracy} and {Terrorism}},\n  date = {2024-12-09},\n  url = {https://bim382.github.io/papers/2024-12-09-Terrorism/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFu, Y.

    "text": "An Example Regression Analysis\nHere is an example regression analysis using the ORCID template and the mtcars dataset to show you some basic syntax when you are writing a quantitative academic research paper.\nFirst, let’s examine the relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency using a scatter plot.\nInsert an r code cell by clicking the Insert Code Cell button on the top bar, and copy and paste the following code into the code cell:\n# Assign a label to the scatter plot for cross-referencing\n# Labels for figures should have the prefix \"fig-\"\n#| label: fig-scatter\n# Assign a caption to the scatter plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Relationship between Car Weight and Fuel Efficiency\"\n# Set echo, warning, and message to false for the plot output only\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n# Install the necessary packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggplot2\", \"dplyr\"))\n# If the packages are already installed, you can skip the above line\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n# Create descriptive statistics plot\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\",\n    y = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n    color = \"Cylinders\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship between Car Weight and Fuel Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll perform a regression analysis. Equations written in syntax should be covered by double dollar signs $$ ... $$ and be assigned a label using {#label} for cross-referencing.\n$$\nmpg = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot weight + \\beta_2 \\cdot cylinders + \\epsilon\n$$ {#eq-regression}  #Labels for equations should have the prefix \"eq-\"\n\\[\nmpg = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot weight + \\beta_2 \\cdot cylinders + \\epsilon\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWe can also use & to align equations. For example, if we want our equations to be aligned at the equal signs and quote them as one group, we can write:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1+2&=3\\\\\n3+4&=7\\\\\n11&=5+6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-group}\nNote that here we use \\begin{aligned} ... \\end{aligned} to align a group of equations, and we use \\\\ to indicate line breaks, and & to indicate the alignment point.\nThe three equations are now quoted as one group and aligned at the equal signs:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1+2&=3\\\\\n3+4&=7\\\\\n11&=5+6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFinally, let’s create a regression table to summarize our regression results. We will use the modelsummary package to create a well-formatted regression table.\n# Assign a label to the regression table for cross-referencing\n# Labels for tables should have the prefix \"tbl-\"\n#| label: tbl-regression\n# Assign a caption to the regression table\n#| tbl-cap: \"Regression Results: Fuel Efficiency Model\"\n# Set echo, warning, and message to false for the plot output only\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n# Fit regression models\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)\n# Create regression table\nmodelsummary(\n  list(\"Model 1\" = model1, \"Model 2\" = model2, \"Model 3\" = model3),\n  stars = TRUE,\n  gof_map = c(\"nobs\", \"r.squared\", \"adj.r.squared\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Regression Results: Fuel Efficiency Model\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                Model 1\n                Model 2\n                Model 3\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n        \n                \n                  (Intercept)\n                  37.285***\n                  39.686***\n                  38.752***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (1.878)\n                  (1.715)\n                  (1.787)\n                \n                \n                  wt\n                  -5.344***\n                  -3.191***\n                  -3.167***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.559)\n                  (0.757)\n                  (0.741)\n                \n                \n                  cyl\n                  \n                  -1.508**\n                  -0.942+\n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  (0.415)\n                  (0.551)\n                \n                \n                  hp\n                  \n                  \n                  -0.018\n                \n                \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  (0.012)\n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.\n                  32\n                  32\n                  32\n                \n                \n                  R2\n                  0.753\n                  0.830\n                  0.843\n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.\n                  0.745\n                  0.819\n                  0.826\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equations, figures, and tables are automatically numbered in a correct sequence, and could be cross-referenced in the text.\nTo create proper cross-references in Quarto, use the following syntax: @label at where you want to make cross references, where label is the label you assigned to the figure, table, or equation.

I’m not a web developer but my plan is to regularly audit my site for accessibility failures and learn how to remedy them as best I can. I’ll be using the following evaluation tools:\n\nWAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool\n\nIn addition, I’ll document the failures and any corrective actions as issues in the GitHub repository housing the files used to build this site."
