# Abstract
This essay revisits the link between democracy and terrorism. Several related divided conclusions proposed in the past are re-examined with new data. An OLS regression with fixed effects and a 2SLS regression are adopted in this essay. The results confirms the common belief that democracy has a positive curvilinear relationship with terrorism. Countries respecting physical integrity would experience less terrorism. High levels of mobilization would inspire terrorism, and new systematic changes
in the dynamic between democracy and terrorism remain to be further explored.
